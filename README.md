### How to develop

#### Running locally for the first time

1. After cloning, run `npm ci`
2. Run `npm run local`, it should open your browser at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

#### Developing a feature

1. After agreeing with the others collaborators which task you are going to do, goto the **master** branch
2. Create a new branch and do your work there
3. Upon finishing don't forget Unit Tests. To test, run `npm run test`. If it fails, you must fix them in order to proceed
4. If everything is ok, open a new Pull Request to **development**. Your PR is going to be blocked if the previous step is failing
